# Yeetcode

![yeetdemo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/473c5e9c-fd5b-48ea-9af5-046647603359)

Yeetcode is a Google Chrome extension where two Leetcode users can battle each other. Since many CS students and developers despise grinding for Leetcode, our team decided to make said grinding more fun, competitive, and rewarding. Both screens update when a player makes a submission for a problem. The player that solves more problems correctly within a set time wins!

### Features
* Signup/Login page
* User profile with both `leetcode_username` and `yeetcode_username`
* Joining/Creating a yeetbattle
* Screens that update upon correct/incorrect submission correct `leetcode_username`
* Appropriate game over screens for win/draw/loss

### To be added
* Elo rating
* Chat functionality
* Customizable user profile
